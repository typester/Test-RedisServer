# NAME

Test::RedisServer - redis-server runner for tests.

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Redis;
use Test::RedisServer;
use Test::More;

my $redis_server;
eval {
    $redis_server = Test::RedisServer->new;
} or plan skip_all => 'redis-server is required for this test';

my $redis = Redis->new( $redis_server->connect_info );

is $redis->ping, 'PONG', 'ping pong ok';

done_testing;
```

# DESCRIPTION

# METHODS

## new(%options)

```perl
my $redis_server = Test::RedisServer->new(%options);
```

Create a new redis-server instance, and start it by default (use auto\_start option to avoid this)

Available options are:

- auto\_start => 0 | 1 (Default: 1)

    Automatically start redis-server instance (by default).
    You can disable this feature by `auto_start => 0`, and start instance manually by `start` or `exec` method below.

- conf => 'HashRef'

    This is a redis.conf key value pair. You can use any key-value pair(s) that redis-server supports.

    If you want to use this redis.conf:

    ```
    port 9999
    databases 16
    save 900 1
    ```

    Your conf parameter will be:

    ```perl
    Test::RedisServer->new( conf => {
        port      => 9999,
        databases => 16,
        save      => '900 1',
    });
    ```

- timeout => 'Int'

    Timeout seconds for detecting if redis-server is awake or not. (Default: 3)

- tmpdir => 'String'

    Temporal directory, where redis config will be stored. By default it is created for you, but if you start Test::RedisServer via exec (e.g. with Test::TCP), you should provide it to be automatically deleted:

## start

Start redis-server instance manually.

## exec

Just exec to redis-server instance. This method is useful to use this module with [Test::TCP](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3A%3ATCP), [Proclet](https://metacpan.org/pod/Proclet) or etc.

```perl
use File::Temp;
use Test::TCP;
my $tmp_dir = File::Temp->newdir( CLEANUP => 1 );

test_tcp(
    client => sub {
        my ($port, $server_pid) = @_;
        ...
    },
    server => sub {
        my ($port) = @_;
        my $redis = Test::RedisServer->new(
            auto_start => 0,
            conf       => { port => $port },
            tmpdir     => $tmp_dir,
        );
        $redis->exec;
    },
);
```

## stop

Stop redis-server instance.

This method is automatically called from object destructor, DESTROY.

## connect\_info

Return connection info for client library to connect this redis-server instance.

This parameter is designed to pass directly to [Redis](https://metacpan.org/pod/Redis) module.

```perl
my $redis_server = Test::RedisServer->new;
my $redis = Redis->new( $redis_server->connect_info );
```

## pid

Return redis-server instance's process id, or undef when redis-server is not running.

## wait\_exit

Block until redis instance exited.

This module steals lots of stuff from above modules.
